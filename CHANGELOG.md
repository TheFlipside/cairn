# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Flutter project scaffold (Android + iOS) with a clean-architecture `lib/src`
  layout and mockable boundary interfaces for health access, OMH mapping,
  local storage, and Nextcloud sync.
- Strict analysis setup (`very_good_analysis` + `strict-casts`/`-inference`/
  `-raw-types`); permissive dependency stack (`health`, `flutter_secure_storage`,
  `http`, `path`, `path_provider`) chosen to keep the app MIT-clean.
- MIT `LICENSE` at the repository root; AGPL boundary for the future Nextcloud
  app documented.
- Project `CLAUDE.md` filled in from the design document.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` covering Flutter and (future) Nextcloud-app setup.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` §15 — structured development plan and phases.

### Fixed

### Security

- Android release builds use an optional, untracked `key.properties` signing
  config; debug keys remain only as a local-development fallback and never sign
  a distributable artifact.
