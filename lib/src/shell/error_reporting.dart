/// Hands a caught [error] to Flutter's error machinery when it is a bug rather
/// than an anticipated failure.
///
/// The UI catches `Object`, not `Exception`, so that nothing can escape and
/// strand a spinner — the health plugin, for one, reports a missing Health
/// Connect with an `UnsupportedError`. The cost of that width is that a genuine
/// programming bug — a `TypeError`, a failed assertion — would land in the same
/// bucket and be shown to the user as a benign "could not read", with only a
/// `debugPrint` left behind for the maintainer.
///
/// So: an `Exception` is an expected outcome and passes silently; anything else
/// is reported where uncaught errors already go. It is *reported*, not
/// rethrown, so the caller still returns its typed failure and the user still
/// gets a message.
///
/// Reach is deliberately local: Cairn wires no crash reporting, by design, so
/// this lands in the debug console and in `logcat` on a release build — not in
/// anyone's inbox. That is enough to make a bug visible to whoever is looking
/// at the device, and it is the most an app that sends nothing anywhere can do.
